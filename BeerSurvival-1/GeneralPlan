Basic JavaScript game using HTML5 Canvas


-Basic Idea:
1. Homer at bottom of screen, controlled with arrow keys
2. Has to catch beer raining from the sky
3. If he misses a certain number of beers, beer level on the floor rises
4. If beer level rises above Homer, he drowns
5. Homer becomes slower the higher the beer level
6. Potatoes and peanuts also fall from the sky, if Homer eats some, he can drink some of the beer on the bottom
7. Maybe other powerups can be included: faster movement, slower beerfall, more food raining.
